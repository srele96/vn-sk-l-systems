## How the L-Systems Canvas implementation came to be

My friend **Vyacheslav Novak** completed the graphics assignments with the highest grade.

He created L-Systems in Java, I was very impressed. I got the idea after a while to do the JavaScript canvas implementation.

I didn't know the algorithms and logic behind them, Vyacheslav Novak did all the leadership work. I was merely his JavaScript tools to write, run and debug the code.
